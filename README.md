# Usability Problems with Visual Studio for Mac

This repo is used to keep track of all of the usability issues I currently have with Visual Studio for Mac.

These issues impact my productivity and sanity. I shouldn't have to be dealing with these issues when I all I want to do is build my apps and get jobs done.

This list is not exhaustive.

## Xamarin Forms
* Red squiggles appear eventually appear for no reason and the app still builds
* Hot Reload just decides to stop working. Setting is now missing from Preferences so cannot be disabled/enabled to reset

## Editors
* Over time, the code editor latency becomes unbearable. Need to restart VS
* XAML formatter started dropping first attribute to next line in an awkward position and then left aligns all subsequent attributes to it.
* New editor has been forced on us but it does not support "Enable Selection Surround Keys" functionality

## Debugger
* Hover over variables in debug mode randomly shows the Type info instead of the current value
* During debug of Xamarin app, stepping to the next line using F10 gives focus to the simulator. I have to click back into the text editor every time I step.

## IDE
* Information Pads are clumsy and not customisable - column widths and column choices. I am ALWAYS resizing columns to see information and hiding columns that are useless to me. Also, minimising all Pads at the bottom cannot be done in one click like in VS Windows, you have to minimise each Pad separately and reopen them separately.
* I cannot synchronise preferences, themes, keyboard mappings, code formatting rules and window layouts across my 3 Macs
* The Application Output pad no longer tracks the end of the stream and stays updated when you launch
* Solution Explorer is still decades behind VS Windows counterpart
* I am continually losing my Apple Developer Accounts (I have 4) and have to set them up again
* Load times are so long now (I miss Xamarin Studio load times)
