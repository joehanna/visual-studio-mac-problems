# Usability Problems with Visual Studio for Mac

This repo is used to keep track of all of the usability issues I currently have with Visual Studio for Mac.

These issues impact my productivity and sanity. I shouldn't have to be dealing with these issues when I all I want to do is build my apps and get jobs done.
